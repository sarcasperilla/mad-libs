# mad-libs

    To play, have ready a text file formatted with 'ADJECTIVE', 'NOUN', 'VERB', or 'ADVERB' (case sensitive)
    where you would like the user to be able to insert their own words.
    
    Call mad_libs() function with argument being the name of this formatted text file to initialize the game.
    User will be prompted to input their words where needed,
    and a new text file (appended with '_completed') will be created reflecting the changes.
